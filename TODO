# Bugs
- stdlib moves line of file, which makes error reporting impossible

# Cleanups
- Improve error reporting (See ./util/string_util::highlight_position_in_file)
- Use .peek() instead of .next() for expression parsing

# Roadmap

## 0.2.0
- Nested expressions like (1 + (2 * 2))
- Type inference
- Multi-file support

## Down the line
- Argument overloading
- Stable C backend
- LLVM support
