# Bugs
- Nested expressions can have invalid parens. E.g.: 6 % 3 == 0 should be true; is false (See test_complex_nested_expressions)
- Arrays as function arguments don't work (See test_array_as_argument)

# Cleanups
- Improve error reporting (See ./util/string_util::highlight_position_in_file)
- Use .peek() instead of .next() for expression parsing
- `x: int` notation is used in multiple places. Can potentially be consolidated
- stdlib moves line of file, which makes error reporting impossible

# Features
- Expect return statement if specified in function
- Type inference
- Multi-file support
- Argument overloading

# Long term
- Stable C backend
- LLVM support
