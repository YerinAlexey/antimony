# Installation

## Git

The fastest way to get up and running is to clone the [repository](https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre) and run the following command:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

> **Note:** An installation of the Rust programming language is needed to compile Sabre.

## Cargo

Install the [latest published version](https://crates.io/crates/sabre-lang) via cargo:

```sh
cargo install sabre-lang
```
