# Common language concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Antimony. Many programming languages have much in common at their core.

Specifically, youâ€™ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Antimony program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
