Sabre is a bullshit-free (Â©) programming language that gets out of your way.
It is meant to "just work", without adding unnecessary and bloated language features.

## State of this projects

Most algorithms should run fine, but some features may be unstable. Standard library is still incomplete. See [TODO](./TODO) for a roadmap.

The Sabre compiler emits JavaScript, and a C backend is currently in development. Backends for WASM, x86 and ARM are planned.

## Examples

```rs
// examples/fib.sb

fn main() {
    let num: int = 10
    println(fib(num))
}

fn fib(n: int) {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n
    }

    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}

// -> 55
```
